# STDMamba: Spatio-Temporal Decomposition Mamba for Long-Term Fine-Grained SST Prediction
Long-Term Fine-Grained Sea Surface Temperature Prediction based on Mamba2

ðŸš©**News**(August 16, 2024): To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce state-space models or Mamba into SST prediction, which solves the modeling difficulties and noise challenges of long-term fine-grained prediction and achieves SOTA performance with real datasets, and we will continue to innovate and improve in this direction, so if you are interested, please stay tuned for more information about our work!
ðŸš©**News**(March 31, 2025): We aim to continue to replace the original bi-directional mechanism, commonly used in most time series models, with the directional Mamba mechanism we newly proposed.

## Main Results on the Northwest Pacific dataset

Compared to the current SOTA models, STDMamba achieves superior performance on the Northwest Pacific dataset and Indian Ocean dataset from NOAAâ€™s publicly available Sea Surface Temperature dataset.
