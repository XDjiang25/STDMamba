# STDMamba: Spatio-Temporal Decomposition Mamba for Long-Term Fine-Grained SST Prediction
Long-Term Fine-Grained Sea Surface Temperature Prediction based on Mamba2

ðŸš©**News**(February 23, 2025): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have introduced state-space modeling, or linear attention, to SST prediction, and we will continue to innovate and improve in this direction, so if you are interested, please follow me on X!

# Resultsâœ…
## Main Results on the Northwest Pacific dataset

Compared to the current SOTA models, STDMamba achieves superior performance on the Northwest Pacific dataset and Indian Ocean dataset from NOAAâ€™s publicly available Sea Surface Temperature dataset.

ðŸš©**News**(March 31, 2025): We aim to continue to replace the original bi-directional mechanism, commonly used in most time series models, with the directional Mamba mechanism we newly proposed.
