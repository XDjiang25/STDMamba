## Main Results

Compared to [iTransformer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JePfAI8fah), the current SOTA Transformer-based model, the MSE results of Bi-Mamba+ are reduced by 4.85% and the MAE results are reduced by 2.70% on average. The improvement comes to 3.85% and 2.75% compared to [S-Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11144).

ðŸš©**News**(February 23, 2025): We aim to replace the original bi-directional mechanism, commonly used in most time series models, with the inner bi-directional Mamba mechanism we newly proposed.
