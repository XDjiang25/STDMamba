# STDMamba: Spatio-Temporal Decomposition Mamba for Long-Term Fine-Grained SST Prediction
Long-Term Fine-Grained Sea Surface Temperature Prediction based on Mamba2

# Results✅
## Main Results

Compared to the current SOTA models, STDMamba achieves superior performance on the Northwest Pacific dataset and Indian Ocean dataset from NOAA’s publicly available Sea Surface Temperature dataset.
